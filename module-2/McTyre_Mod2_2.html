            <h1>Assignment 2.3 – Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
            <h2>A summary of me!</h2>
            <p class="intro">    <span class="sentence">Hello there! I'm Daniel McTyre, a Software Development student at Bellevue University.</span>
            I'm currently in my third year, and am using this opportunity to introduce myself. I live
            in Orlando, Florida, where I work at Walt Disney World, making sweet treats (like candy and 
            caramel apples, rice krispy treats, marshmallow wands, etc....). Thanks to Disney, I have this 
            opportunity to learn many different languages, and hope to broaden my skillset greatly. </p>
            <p>    When I'm not at work or doing schoolwork, I have a variety of hobbies to turn to. My
            favorite is retro computers and video games. I have always loved vintage computing, not out of
            a sense of nostalgia, but for the grainy and sleek aesthetic, and for how programmers of that era
            made so much with so seemingly little (especially in the Apollo missions!). I own a variety of old
            computers (e.g. TI/99, Apple II, Atari 400, a 1990's Macintosh) and video game consoles (e.g
            Atari 2600, SNES) that I try to take good care of, as well as a variety of boxed computer games. 
            One of my biggest life goals is to make a new game for an old platform, likely on the NES or classic
            Macintosh. It would be a tall order, but something I'm willing to take on.</p>
            <p>    Other hobbies that I have usually involve outdoors or exercise stuff. For one, I love doing
            weekly ice skating (especially for the cardio and cold weather mix). I'm not great at it, but I love 
            what I get from it anyway. I also love going to local nature sites with my girlfriend. We're especially
            fond of botanical gardens, and places where we can swim (especially natural sites). I also enjoy hiking
            and amateur gardening a lot, even though I'm very much just a padawan in the latter. I also enjoy learning
            art, especially pixel art design, influenced by old school computing.
            </p>
            <p>    For my own little history: I have lived in five different states. I was born in Memphis,
            Tennessee, on April 30, 1990. From there, I have lived in: Maryland, Oklahoma, Texas (San Antonio
            is where my immediate family resides), and now, Florida. I have things I liked about each of those
            states, but Texas is my favorite, especially for the top-tier Mexican food, and endless sites to see.
            And of course, my family, whom I all love.</p>
